# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project is a data analysis exploration of global COVID-19 data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as total cases, deaths, testing rates, and vaccination progress across selected countries. Visualizations such as bar charts, heatmaps, and line plots help reveal patterns and insights in the pandemic’s impact and response.

## 🧠 Objectives of the Project

- Analyze COVID-19 trends across countries with similar population density and area
- Compare total cases, deaths, and vaccinations among selected countries
- Visualize daily new cases and cumulative vaccination progress
- Create insightful plots: bar graphs, line plots, and heatmaps
- Reflect on vaccine distribution and pandemic outcomes.
